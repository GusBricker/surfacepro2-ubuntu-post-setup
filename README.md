surfacepro2-ubuntu-post-setup
=============================
A set of post setup scripts to make Ubuntu work nicely on the Surface Pro 2.
These scripts have only been tested on Ubuntu 14.04.


## Running
sudo ./setup.sh
The script will also make a log file with its full output in the same directory where it resides.


## Kernel Used
The current kernel is a custom one built from [here](https://github.com/GusBricker/surfacepro2-kernel).


## What Works
- Hibernate (suspend to disk)
- Sleep (suspend to RAM)
- Internal Wifi (sometimes gives issues)
- Typecover (including hotplugging)
- Touchscreen
- Pen
- Volume Rocker
- Basic gestures (using ginn)
- Basic power saving
- Front facing camera
- USB 3.0
- USB 2.0


## Discussion
There is a long thread on the Ubuntu forums which is where these scripts got their insperation from. It can be found [here](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2183946&page=1).
